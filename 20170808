Using DOM Document Object In VB

1.We need to add reference to use these libraries

I tested this object in VBA envirenment and found very lots of versions:

Microsoft XML, v3.0
Microsoft XML, v4.0
Microsoft XML, v5.0 (well, I also found some CHM file about this version in my local machine)
Microsoft XML, v6.0

And I found they are basically some kinds of DLL files:
msxml3.dll
msxml4.dll
msxml5.dll
msxml6.dll

So I learned before that these dlls are some Dynamic Linkage Libraries, so seems it is true.

Then I tried to add these together, but VBE gave a warning message like this: 

  Name conflicts with existing module, project, or object library.
  
So seems these dll are also object libraries.

Ok, I think it is a good thing because maybe it is all the same if we want to add some kinds of references of the objects in the visual
basic development envirenment.So we use these dll files and they will be used as object libraries.

So I used the newest version, v6.0

1)UserForm1.frm

    Private Sub UserForm_Initialize()

    Dim doc As New DOMDocument60
    doc.async = False
    doc.validateOnParse = False
    doc.resolveExternals = False

    Path = "C:\Users\XP022270\Desktop\New folder" + "\test.xml"

    loaded = doc.Load(Path)

    MsgBox "doc: " & doc.XML 'All the xml contents will be shown in Message Box
    MsgBox "doc: " & loaded 'loaded will be true if we loaded the xml correctly

    MsgBox Path

    End Sub

2)test.xml
    <?xml version="1.0"?>
      <root>
         <node>one</node>
         <nodes>
            <node>1</node>
            <node>2</node>
         </nodes>
         <node>two</node>
      </root>

Here I found is that the whole xml file is dumped into the message box. Shown and popped up.

Cool. So is it always used like this? The dll files?
